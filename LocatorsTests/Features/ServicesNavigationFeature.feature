  @smoke
  Scenario: Navigate to Generative AI service category by hovering navigation bar and validate content
    Given I open Services navigation bar
    When I click on the "<ServiceCategory>" service category
    Then "<ServiceCategory>" should contain the expected text
	And Our Related Expertise should be displayed
    Examples:

      | Responsible AI   |
